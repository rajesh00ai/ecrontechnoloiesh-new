# Data Integration Guide

This file has been removed as Supabase integration has been completely removed from the project.

## Next Steps

To integrate with your preferred data storage solution:

1. **Choose your database service** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.)
2. **Set up authentication** (Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom JWT, etc.)
3. **Update the following files**:
   - `client/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Replace with your API calls
   - `client/src/lib/auth.ts` - Replace with your auth service
   - `server/routes.ts` - Connect to your database
   - `client/src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Update auth logic

4. **Configure environment variables** in `.env` file
5. **Test all forms and authentication flows**
