# Data Integration Documentation

**Note: Supabase integration has been completely removed from this project.**

## Current Status

All Supabase-related code has been replaced with placeholder functions that log to console and return mock data. The application will run successfully but won't persist any data.

## What Was Removed

- All Supabase imports and client initialization
- Database queries and mutations
- Authentication system integration
- Environment variables for Supabase
- Migration files (preserved as requested)

## Next Steps

To make the application functional with real data storage:

1. **Choose your preferred services**:
   - Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.
   - Authentication: Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom JWT, etc.

2. **Update these key files**:
   - `client/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Replace API calls
   - `client/src/lib/auth.ts` - Replace auth service
   - `server/routes.ts` - Connect to your database
   - `client/src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Update auth logic

3. **Forms requiring integration**:
   - Contact messages (`/api/contact`)
   - Course applications (`/api/course-applications`) 
   - Demo scheduling (`/api/demo-applications`)
   - Newsletter subscriptions (`/api/newsletter/subscribe`)
   - Event registrations (`/api/event-registrations`)

4. **Authentication features to implement**:
   - User registration and login
   - Password reset
   - Profile management
   - Role-based access control

All placeholder functions are marked with `TODO:` comments for easy identification.
